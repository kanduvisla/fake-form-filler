# Fake Form Filler

> A Fake Form Filler extension for Chromium-based browsers

---

Since I was unable to find a form filler to fill some gibberish
in my local development setup, I decided to make my own that works
for me.

It's currently mostly tailored to Magento 2, since that's the kind
of project I'm working on the most, but feel free to contribute 
if you want.
